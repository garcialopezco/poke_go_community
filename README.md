This is a simple web app just to play around a little with Rails 5.2.

## About Poke Go Community

It is intended to help Pokemon Go trainers organize Raids so they can see what Raids are active and how many trainers have confirmed their attendance.

### Current Features

* Trainer signup
* List of Raids
* Ability to create new Raids that are visible to all registered trainers

### Considerations

You may need to add manually all the gyms for your city.

### Some Screenshots

Coming soon!

### Future plans

* Improve Raid listing using your phone's location
* Add a Telegram bot in order to receive notifications
